Hello,
First of all thanks for the chance.
I tried to use different method of programming like:
- URLSession.shared.dataTask, i believe most of the projects use it, but i know there is an async await way to do it, which is more recent.
- different ways to use AsyncImage
- data injection
- reuse of small components
- simple animation, i love playing with more complex animatin.
- i used the preview at all moment for a better experience
- differents ways to pass data like sharing the model itself, or just the values needed
- use of wrappers
- use nsuserdefault, but i also like appstorage.
