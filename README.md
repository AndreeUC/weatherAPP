# weatherAPP

Hello,
First of all thanks for the chance.

The first time the app runs users need to enter a city, if is a valid city he will city a small card with few details, if user tabs on it more details will be displayed.
the city entered will be save, so the next time you open the app you will the previous selected city, you can lokk for more cities.



I tried to use different method of programming like:
- URLSession.shared.dataTask, i believe most of the projects use it, but i know there is an async await way to do it, which is more recent.
- different ways to use AsyncImage
- data injection
- reuse of small components
- simple animation, i love playing with more complex animatin.
- i used the preview at all moment for a better experience
- differents ways to pass data like sharing the model itself, or just the values needed
- use of wrappers
- use nsuserdefault, but i also like appstorage.
